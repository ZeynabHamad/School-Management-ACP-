## Maintenance and support
The project will be maintained by the team until all the initially gathered requirements are deployed, building new functionalities after the final deployment requires more budget, but building extra functionality during development can be done, if the core requirements are not changed that require a new structure, the project will be supported for bug fixes for one month after deployment.
 
## Project Timeline
The expected development period of the project is 24 weeks, the project will be deployed by week 10 but with only the required features that were requested by dr.Polla Fattah, the students will not be able to use the system first until week 15.

## Software Process
We use the iterative software development process,because we need to implement a small set of the software requirements until the system is complete.
The iterative software model develops a system through building small portions of all the features. This helps to meet initial scope quickly and release it for feedback
